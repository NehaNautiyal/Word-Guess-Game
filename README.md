# Word-Guess-Game

## Overview

This game is a hangman-style game that allows you to choose 1 alpha character to guess the name of an element on the Periodic Table. 

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript 

## How it Works

You have 10 chances to guess letters that are in the element name. 
With any incorrect guesses, the letters will be displayed so as not to choose the same letters again. 
With every incorrect guess, the guesses you have remaining decreases by 1. 
If you spell out the element name and have guesses remaining, you win a point. 
If you are unable to guess the element name and run out of guesses, your losses increase by 1 point.
Once you have correctly guessed an element name, its image will appear with its atomic number, chemical symbol and photo.
